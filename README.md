# twitter_sentiment_analyzer
A short sentiment analyzer of Tweets using Textblob's modules.


Pre-requisites: 
Access to Twitter Developer API (You can sign up here: [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard))

Python

To run this, download the code, put it into a folder with an additional file named "tweets.csv" and then import the generated authentication keys from the Twitter Developer API. The ones used in this file are outdated, though they are left in to get an example of the general format. Next, execute the python file in the console using "sentiment_analyzer.py". It will not run immediately since it requires an input. Type in a field for the topic to search such as "politics", "water", or literally anything you want. After that, it should be complete. Check your "tweets.csv" file, export it into Excel or Google Sheets, and voila!
